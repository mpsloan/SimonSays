This program asks the user which difficulty level they would like to play at and denies any answer besides
easy, medium, or hard. Easy mode prints out an ever increasing list of random colors: red, blue, green and yellow.
Medium mode prints out an ever increasing list of random numbers 1-9. Hard mode prints out and ever increasing
list of random lowercase characters. The answers are marked correct regardless of spacing and capitalization and
the users score is output after each correct answer. Once the user gets the question wrong, the program outputs 
the users final score, and gives them the option to play again. If the user chooses yes they are prompted to
choose their difficulty level again and if they give and invalid answer they will be prompted with the same 
question regarding whether they would like to play again.
